# Human-Paced Navigation Settings

## ✅ New Ultra-Calm Configuration

### Timing Changes:
- **Movement threshold**: 80px → **150px** (only major movements)
- **Spatial cooldown**: 15s → **30 seconds** (won't repeat for 30s)
- **Safety cooldown**: 20s → **40 seconds** (very patient)
- **VLM updates**: Every 10s → **Every 20 seconds**
- **Scene change**: 25% → **35%** (much less sensitive)

### Detection Quality:
- **YOLO confidence**: 50% → **65%** (fewer false positives)
- Only detects objects it's very sure about

## Expected Behavior:
- Announcements **every 30-40 seconds minimum**
- Only for **truly significant objects** (people, large vehicles)
- Scene descriptions **every 20 seconds**
- Much quieter, calm, human-paced experience

Like a professional GPS that only speaks when necessary! 🎯
